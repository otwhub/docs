## Connect your first app

From the dashboard, start by adding a new app.

You can connect Appinion to your App Store and Google Playstore App.

After connecting, Appinion will automatically start importing reviews.

<Note>
  The first sync may take a few seconds depending on the number of reviews.

Once reviews are available, you can start exploring :
