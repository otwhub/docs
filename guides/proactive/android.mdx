### Integration

Using gradle.

### SDK initialization

Implement the SDKManagerInterface

```kotlin Appdelegate.swift
class YourClass : Fragment(), SDKManagerInterface

override fun authenticate(resp: Boolean) {
	// This method returns true if sdk is authenticated
}
```

Declare the SDKManager as soon as possible

```kotlin
public lateinit var sdkManager: SDKManager
```

Initialize the SDK as soon as possible on your App life cycle

```kotlin
activity?.let {
	this.sdkManager = SDKManager(this, it)
	this.sdkManager.authenticate(
	appID = "###APP_ID###",
	clientID = "###CLIENT_ID###",
	clientSecret = "###CLIENT_SECRET###"
}
```

### Configure a stage

On the Viewcontroller you wish to call the proactive feedback prompt, first configure your stage.

<Info>
  The STAGE NAME must match the on you have created on the Appinion Dashboard.
</Info>

Launch the Proactive feedback prompt with the configuration for this stage.

```kotlin
activity?.let {
	this.sdkManager.storeFeedbackConfiguration(###STAGE_NAME###)
}
```
