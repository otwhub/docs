  Uncheck all except:

  1. View app information and download bulk reports (read-only) – so you’re only giving the Visibility permission to Appinion. This allows us to access the data in the Reports section of your Console account, which is where we obtain the historical review data.
  2. Reply to reviews – so you can reply from within Appinion.

  Then press Invite User.
