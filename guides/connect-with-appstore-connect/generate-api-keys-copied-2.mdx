  This requires **Account Holder** or **Admin** access for the App Store Connect account. 

  1. In your App Store Connect account, go to **Users and Access**, then open the **Integrations** tab.
  2. You’ll land on the **App Store Connect API** page under **Team Keys**. Click the **\+** button to create a new Team API key.
  3. Enter a name for the key. This name is for your reference only and is not part of the key itself.
  4. Under **Access**, select **Admin**.
  5. Team API keys apply to all apps in your account and cannot be limited to a single app. When you’re ready, click **Generate**.
  6. Finally, copy the **Issuer ID** and **Key ID**, and download the **API key file**. You’ll need these details to complete the connection in Appinion.

Once an API key is generated, its name and access level cannot be changed. If you need to update either, you must revoke the key and create a new one.
