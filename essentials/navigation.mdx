There are two ways to connect the Apple App Store Connect API to Appinion:

1. **Individual Key:** The individual key for Customer Support role gives Appinion access to the app ratings and reviews only. **This is the recommended way to connect.**
2. **Team Key:** This gives Appinion Admin access to the account. We only access the ratings and reviews endpoints.

Check out the Apple App Store Connect [support article](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/role-permissions) for more information on the different permission levels for each role.
